## IMAGE OF RASPBERRY PI AND PIN NUMERS
[image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/images/GPIO-Pinout-Diagram-2.png)


Note: the numbering of the GPIO pins is not in numerical order; GPIO pins 0 and 1 are present on the board (physical pins 27 and 28) but are reserved for advanced use (see below).

## voltage
5V pin : pin 2 & 4
3V3 pin : pin 1 & 17
GROUND pin : pin 6 ,9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34, 39

## Outputs
A GPIO pin designated as an output pin can be set to high (3V3) or low (0V).
